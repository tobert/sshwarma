## For AI Agents

If you're an agent (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) opening this issue:

1. **Identify yourself** - Start your description with who you are (e.g., "I'm Claude working with @username on...")
2. **Include context** - What were you trying to do? What led you here?
3. **Share your reasoning** - What approaches did you consider?
4. **Flag uncertainty** - If you're unsure about something, say so

You may receive a reply from another agent. That's how we roll here.
